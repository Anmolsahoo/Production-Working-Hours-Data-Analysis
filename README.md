<h1>Project Description</h1>

Efficient use of working hours in production is crucial for improving productivity, reducing costs, and ensuring timely delivery of goods. This project focuses on analyzing Production Working Hours Data using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into how working hours are distributed across employees, shifts, and production units.
The dataset contains details such as employee working hours, overtime, planned vs. actual time, department performance, and production targets. By transforming raw time-tracking data into meaningful insights, this project enables managers to monitor productivity, identify inefficiencies, and make better workforce-related decisions.

<h1>Objective</h1>

The main objectives of this project are:

  -To analyze total working hours, overtime, and productivity across departments.

  -To compare planned working hours against actual working hours.

  -To identify employees, shifts, or departments where underutilization or overutilization exists.

  -To highlight areas where working hour imbalances impact production efficiency.

  -To provide visual and interactive insights to help managers improve workforce allocation.

<h1>Power BI File</h1>

The Power BI file (Production Working Hours Data Analysis.pbix) contains an interactive dashboard with the following key features:

  -Overall Hours Overview: Displays total planned vs. actual working hours, overtime hours, and efficiency rates.

  -Department/Unit Analysis: Breaks down hours by department, production line, or unit.

  -Shift-wise Analysis: Compares day, evening, and night shifts to see where working hours are most effectively utilized.

  -Employee Performance: Identifies employees with consistent overtime or underutilization.

  -Trend Analysis: Line and bar charts showing changes in working hours and productivity over time.

The dashboard is dynamic, allowing managers to filter by department, employee, or date range for deeper insights.

<h1>Results</h1>

The analysis from the dashboard provides valuable findings:

  -Some departments consistently show higher actual hours than planned, indicating possible overwork or poor planning.

  -Overtime is concentrated among specific employees and shifts, highlighting the need for better workforce distribution.

  -Certain units or shifts show underutilization of staff, leading to wasted capacity.

  -Trend analysis reveals peak production periods where overtime spikes, allowing managers to better forecast and allocate resources.

  -Comparisons of efficiency show which teams complete tasks within planned hours and which exceed targets.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

The Production Working Hours Data Analysis project demonstrates the power of using data analytics to improve workforce management. By visualizing planned vs. actual hours, overtime, and departmental performance, the dashboard gives managers clear insights into productivity and efficiency.
With these findings, organizations can optimize workforce allocation, reduce unnecessary overtime, and ensure fair distribution of work across employees and shifts. The project also highlights areas where better planning and forecasting can reduce production bottlenecks.
Overall, this project shows how Power BI dashboards can transform time-tracking data into actionable insights, helping businesses improve efficiency, reduce costs, and achieve sustainable growth in production performance.
